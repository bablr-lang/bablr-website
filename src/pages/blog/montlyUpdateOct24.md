This will be the frist post in a series that is intended to keep everyone up
to date on developments around the BABLR Ecosystem. To those who have not yet
heard, Conrad and I have founded a formal entity with the goal of supporting
and pushing the development of BABLR and it's asoociated tools. We are
currently working on the product and preparing pitches and demos for
investors. I recently attended the gAlpha program by gener8tor to help
develop the business end and I am happy to say that I have come out of the
program feeling like I have a lot of new thoughts and ideas about how to move
the business forward. Part of that was seeing the need to begin publicly
documenting the progress we are making outside of Github so that the
information might be more readily available.  

While I have been off learning about the busniness, Conrad has been hard at
work on product development and we are seeing very promising results. (agAST)
[https://github.com/bablr-lang/agast-vm], (CSTML)
[https://github.com/bablr-lang/language-en-cstml] and the (BABLR)
[https://github.com/bablr-lang/bablr] engine itself, are all seeing heavy
development, rapid iteration, and marked improvements. 

## Notable Development Milestones

- 
-
- Deno Cli shipped so BABLR's cli can work when invoked from Deno  

## Other news

One of the tasks that has been keeping me busy has been developing this
website. Right now it is mostly stubbed out pages, and layouts with little
style or flair, but we are hoping to get content going as soon as we have a
real product to target (or maybe sooner). Eventually this will be the hub for
all things BABLR. You can hope to find tutorials on builing grammars, docs on
how to make use of all of BABLR's rich features, and informative blog posts
detailing the engineering process right here at bablr.org.

If you would like to contribute to the building of the website or any part of
BABLR, feel free to hop into our (Discord)
[https://discord.gg/pTbg4JGEZp]. There is no shortage of work that needs
doing and we have tasks that need doing at a wide array of skill levels. Any
and all help is welcome!
